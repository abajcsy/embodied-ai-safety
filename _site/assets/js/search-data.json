    "content": "Safety is a nuanced concept. For embodied systems, like robots, we commonly equate safety with collision-avoidance. But out in the ‚Äúopen world‚Äù it can be much more: for example, a safe mobile manipulator should understand when it is not confident about a requested task and understand that areas roped off by caution tape should never be breached. However, designing systems with such a nuanced understanding is an outstanding challenge, especially in the era of large robot behavior models. In this graduate seminar class, we study the question of if (and how) the rise of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models (e.g., deep neural trajectory predictors, large vision-language models, and latent world models) can be harnessed to unlock new avenues for generalizing safety to the open world. From a foundations perspective, we study safety methods from two complementary communities: control theory (which enables the computation of safe decisions) and machine learning (which enables uncertainty quantification and anomaly detection). Throughout the class, there will also be several guest lectures from experts in the field. Students will practice essential research skills including reviewing papers, writing project proposals, and technical communication. Prerequisites . The course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates. While there are no strict prerequisites, familiarity with sequential decision-making, machine learning, optimization, and probability are highly encouraged. Experience with high-level programming languages like Python or MATLAB are also strongly encouraged. ",

Paper summaries are 1-2 paragraph descriptions of the reading assignments that will be submitted to Canvas. Paper presentations occur during in-class discussions. | Homeworks: This course will have a few (1-2) implementation-based homeworks that allow you to apply techniques from the class. | Project: Students will engage in a semester-long research project related to the themes of the course before presenting them at the end of the semester. Early in the semester we ask for a required, 0% project proposal that takes the form of an extended abstract: you want to motivate the topic you have chosen and the technical questions that you want to investigate. By this stage, you should have decided if you are doing a project on your own or in a group. Midway through the semester, students will submit mid-term reports as a checkpoint to ensure that you are making progress towards your final project.
