    "content": "Safety is a nuanced concept. For embodied systems, like robots, we commonly equate safety with collision-avoidance. But out in the “open world” it can be much more: for example, a safe mobile manipulator should understand when it is not confident about a requested task and understand that areas roped off by caution tape should never be breached. However, designing systems with such a nuanced understanding is an outstanding challenge, especially in the era of large robot behavior models. In this graduate seminar class, we study the question of if (and how) the rise of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models (e.g., deep neural trajectory predictors, large vision-language models, and latent world models) can be harnessed to unlock new avenues for generalizing safety to the open world. From a foundations perspective, we study safety methods from two complementary communities: control theory (which enables the computation of safe decisions) and machine learning (which enables uncertainty quantification and anomaly detection). Throughout the class, there will also be several guest lectures from experts in the field. Students will practice essential research skills including reviewing papers, writing project proposals, and technical communication. Prerequisites . The course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates. While there are no strict prerequisites, familiarity with sequential decision-making, machine learning, optimization, and probability are highly encouraged. Experience with high-level programming languages like Python or MATLAB are also strongly encouraged. ",

Students are permitted 2 unexcused absences, no questions asked, before being docked. | Homeworks: This course will have a few Python implementation-based homeworks that allow you to apply techniques from the class. | Paper Summaries &amp; Discussions: One goal we have for this course is for you to understand how to consume, explain, and critique research papers. There will be several paper discussion days during which you will be assigned research papers to read. Paper discussions occur in-class. Before a paper discussion day, you are expected to complete all assigned readings and submit paper summaries to Canvas by 10am ET of the day the reading will be discussed. The paper summaries must answer the following questions: . | What does safety “mean” in this work? | Does the notion of safety apply to a single component / model of the autonomy pipeline, or to the overall “system”? Justify. | What do you like about this work? | . | Project: Students will engage in a semester-long research project related to the themes of the course before presenting them at the end of the semester. The class project can be either an exploration of an original research idea or a thorough literature review (∼ 50 relevant papers, organized so that it identifies gaps in the state of the art). You must work in a group of min 3 and max 5 people. Explicit permission from Andrea must be granted if you want to work on an independent project. To help you make progress throughout the semester, we have three check-points: . | Project Proposal: Early in the semester, students will submit a project proposal / pitch via Canvas. | Midterm Project Check-in: Midway through the semester, students will submit a mid-term report via Canvas and give an oral presentation in-class about the status of their project. | Final Project: The final project consists of an oral project presentation as well as a final project report of the length of a typical robotics or machine learning conference paper (6 pages). | . | .
